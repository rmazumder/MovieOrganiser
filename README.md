# MovieOrganiser
Movie manager


This application scans your hard disk for movies and creates metadata and stores them in database. 
It uses IMDB and Rotten tomatoes api to fetch movie detail and user raiting.

It has export feature to export movies metadata in json format , so that that can be compare with
other collection.

It uses, Angularjs , Jquery, Rest full webservices etc ...
I developed this application while I was learning the angularjs
